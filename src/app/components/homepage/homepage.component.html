        <h4>What is this Gamification Website About?</h4>
        <p>
          Some students have told us they wanted more practice questions, while at the same time, some
          students protested about the heavy workload in the course. As a solution, we have developed this
          Gamification website to provide practice questions for you. The great thing is that doing the
          practice questions is completely optional. And, if you do the practice questions, you will earn
          tokens. When you have collected enough tokens, you can trade them in for marks in the course! That
          means, the more you practice here, the more you are able to make up for lost marks on assignments
          and exams (based on pre-set rules).
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that this setup is flexible enough to accommodate those who want more practice with
          programming, those who are willing to do extra work to improve their marks in the course, and those
          who are simply happy with the way the course is.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an added bonus, we have developed novel exercises that will hopefully entice young students like
          yourselves. We have also dedicated a lot of time to incorporate different types of exercises and
          question formats, tailored towards students at different skill levels. We hope to improve the
          learning experience for all first year CS students.
