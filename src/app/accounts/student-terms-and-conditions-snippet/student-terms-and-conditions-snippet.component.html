    <h3>Study Objectives</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        The objective of this work is to develop educational software that helps students and course administrators to
        automatically generate and interpret feedback from assignment submissions in a course.
    </p>
    <h3>Procedure: Software Feedback Usefulness (Total Expected Time: 0.5 hours)</h3>
    <div>
        <ol class="tui-list tui-list_ordered">
            <li class="tui-list__item tui-island__paragraph">
                As part of the course, you will work on assignments and submit them as usual. Nothing will change from
                standard procedures.
            </li>
            <li class="tui-list__item tui-island__paragraph">
                You can use the software as much or as little as you need to in order to complete the course work required
                by your instructor. There are many educational activities available in the software that you can use
                throughout the semester.
            </li>
            <li class="tui-list__item tui-island__paragraph">
                At the end of the course, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire that helps us identify what
                was useful for you and what changes you would like to see in the future.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        There are no known risks to participants that as there is nothing more than what you would normally be doing for
        studying purposes regardless of their participation in the study.
    </p>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        The participants may gain a better understanding of the concepts that you practice on through the software, may
        develop an appreciation for learning analytics software, and may develop interest in the research and development
        process.
    </p>
    <h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        Questionnaires and computer logs are anonymous. Names of participants will be stored separately from information
        collected by a neutral third party from UBC Okanagan IT department, Olivier Dube. Therefore, the instructor of the
        course will not get access to participants’ information until after the course appeal date. During this time, the
        instructor will only have access to anonymized version of your data. Information collected include all your
        electronically submitted programming work and associated marks (such as labs and assignments). Your name will not be
        associated in any way with the information collected about you or your usage of the computer during the study.
        Furthermore, because the interest of this study is to identify average responses and behavior of the entire group of
        participants, you will not be identified in any way in any written reports of this research.
    </p>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph tui-space_top-2">
        In the case that your instructor provides a bonus mark incentive to participating in this study, the list of
        participants will be provided to the instructor to update your course grade. To get the bonus mark, you may opt to
        not participate and complete an alternate assignment instead. In the case that your instructor does not provide a
        bonus mark incentive for participation, no information is given to the instructor whether you participated or not.
    </p>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph tui-space_top-2">
        Participants have a right to access their own results so long as their names and numeric tags are still available.
        The data obtained from both components of the study will be retained for at least 5 years after publication in
        secured, electronic form, which only researchers associated with this research will have access to. No audio or
        video tapes will be used. General results of the research study may be available through publications. A summary of
        the results will be made available to participants upon request.
    </p>
    <h3>Access to Course Work and Associated Grades</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">

        and grades. The grades will only be used for research analysis purposes without including any of the participants’
        personal information. You can participate in this study by giving us access to your submitted course work, the
        associated grades, or both. In the case you decided to not participate in this study, you will be provided with an
        alternative assignment for getting the bonus mark.
