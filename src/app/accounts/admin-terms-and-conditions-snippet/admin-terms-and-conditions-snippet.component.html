    <h3>Study Objectives</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        The objective of this work is to develop educational software that helps students and course administrators to
        automatically generate and interpret feedback from assignment submissions in a course.
    </p>
    <h3>Procedure: Software Feedback Usefulness (Total Expected Time: 1 hour)</h3>

        <ol class="tui-list tui-list_ordered">
            <li class="tui-list__item tui-island__paragraph">
                A student researcher will visit your class without your presence to explain the study and the consent form
                to the students.
            </li>
            <li class="tui-list__item tui-island__paragraph">
                As part of the course, your students will work on assignments and submit them as usual. Nothing will change
                from standard procedures.
            </li>
            <li class="tui-list__item tui-island__paragraph">
                You and the students can use the software as much or as little as you see fit. There are many educational
                activities available in the software that you can use throughout the semester.
            </li>
            <li class="tui-list__item tui-island__paragraph">
                At the end of the course, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire that helps us identify what
                was useful for you and what changes you would like to see in the future.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        There are no known risks to participants that as there is nothing more than what you would normally be doing for
        teaching purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        The participants may gain a better understanding of the students learningâ€™s learning process, may develop an
        appreciation for learning analytics software, and may develop interest in the research and development process.
    </p>
    <h3>Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph">
        Questionnaires and computer logs are anonymous. Names of participants will be stored separately from information
        collected. Your name will not be associated in any way with the information collected about you or your usage of the
        computer during the study. Furthermore, because the interest of this study is to identify average responses and
        behavior of the entire group of participants, you will not be identified in any way in any written reports of this
        research.
    </p>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph tui-space_top-2">
        Since we are only interested in average responses and behaviors, reports about individual students will not be
        produced or released. You may choose to provide a bonus mark in the course as an incentive for students to
        participate in this study. If you choose to do so, we will provide you with a list of consented participants. If you
        choose not to do so, then student participation will have no impact on their course grade. Meanwhile, if any student
        decided not to participate in the study, they can be provided with an alternative question for the additional bonus
        mark. If you decided to not offer an alternative bonus question, all bonus marks for the participation will be
        cancelled.
    </p>
    <p class="tui-island__paragraph tui-space_top-2">
        Participants have a right to access their own results as long as their names and numeric tags are still available.
        The data obtained from both components of the study will be retained for at least 5 years after publication in
        secured, electronic form, which only researchers associated with this research will have access to. No audio or
        video tapes will be used. General results of the research study may be available through publications. A summary of
        the results will be made available to participants upon request.
